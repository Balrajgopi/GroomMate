<h3>Your personal grooming assistant.</h3>

<hr />

<p>
    The GroomMate project was developed as a modern, streamlined online appointment booking system specifically designed for a men's salon. The primary goal is to replace traditional, time-consuming booking methods (like phone calls or walk-ins) with an efficient and user-friendly digital platform.
</p>

<h4>Project Vision</h4>
<p>
    Our vision is to enhance the customer experience by providing a convenient way to schedule grooming services anytime, anywhere. Simultaneously, we aim to optimize the salon's operational workflow by automating appointment management, reducing administrative tasks for staff, and providing clear business insights for the administrator.
</p>

<h4>Key Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Portal:</strong> New and existing customers can register, log in, browse available services (like haircuts, shaves, and beard trims), and book appointments with their preferred staff member at a convenient time.</li>
    <li><strong>Staff Dashboard:</strong> Salon staff can log in to view their daily and weekly schedules, manage their upcoming appointments, and track their service history.</li>
    <li><strong>Admin Dashboard:</strong> The salon administrator has a comprehensive overview of all business operations, including total appointments, customer management, staff scheduling, and service listings.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technology Stack</h4>
<p>
    GroomMate is built using a robust and scalable technology stack:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Framework:</strong> ASP.NET MVC with .NET Framework 4.8</li>
    <li><strong>Language:</strong> C#</li>
    <li><strong>Database:</strong> SQL Server with Entity Framework 6 (Code-First approach)</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> A custom Role-Based Authentication system to ensure secure access for Customers, Staff, and Admins.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This project demonstrates a real-world application of web development principles to solve a practical business problem, creating a seamless connection between the salon and its clientele.
